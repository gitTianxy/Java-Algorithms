# Algorithms in Java
* data structure
* dynamic programming
* graph
* sort
* greedy
* divide & conquer

---
## data structure
* queue
* stack

## dynamic programming
* get most golden

## graph
* poisson disk distribution

## sort
### `O(n^2)`
* bubble sort
* insertion sort
* select sort

### `O(nlogn)`
* quick sort
* merge sort
* heap sort

### `O(n)`
* bucket sort
* radix sort
* counting sort

## greedy
### condition
* limit condition
* max expectation
* given local-best-solution, step by step, can finally achieve global-best-solution
* pre-best-solution contribute positively to later selection 

### application
* max package value
* Hoffman coding
* range overlap

## divide & conquer
### condition
* simple divide & combination
* sub-task independent with each other
* each sub-task has similar structure with original task (main difference with "dynamic programming")
* their is a termination for divide, and the terminal-task is simple to do

### strategy
1. divide
2. solve
3. combine

### application
* nearest node couple on 2-D plane
*
